## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: Step 1:Import numpy into the editor
### Step 2: Input the co-ordinates to calculate the distance between them.
### Step 3: Substitute the values in the distance formula ![formula](
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)

import math
l2=[10,6]
l1=[4,2] 
d=math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2)) 
print('{:.2f}'.format(d))  


### OUTPUT:
